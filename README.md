# MetacommunityDynamics
Supporting code for Metacommunity dynamics and the spurious detection of species associations in co-occurrence analyses by Vincent Calcagno, Nik J. Cunniffe and Frédéric M. Hamelin. 

The repository contains five files (note: the last is still to be uploadad)
  - generalisedMetapopulations.R: the library to simulate patch occupancy matrices according to our generalised metapopulation model, and to do various calculations
  - metapopulationDynamics.Rmd: a R Markdown which creates all figures in the paper, to show how the library can be used
  - refs.bib: the bibtex file referred to in the R Markdown file
  - metapopulationDynamicsTest.html: the knitted output of the R Markdown file when knitted with testRun <- TRUE on L38
  - metapopulationDynamics.html: the knitted output of the R Markdown file when knitted with testRun <- FALSE on L38 (this replicates all results in the paper)
